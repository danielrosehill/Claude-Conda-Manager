Compare two or more Conda environments to understand their differences and similarities.

Usage: /compare-envs [env1] [env2] [env3...]

Tasks:
1. Export package lists for specified environments
2. Identify packages present in one environment but not others
3. Find packages with different versions across environments
4. Compare Python versions across environments
5. Identify shared packages and versions
6. Calculate package overlap percentage
7. Compare total environment sizes
8. Identify unique dependencies in each environment
9. Check for conflicting package versions
10. Compare channel sources for packages
11. Analyze which environment is more up-to-date
12. Identify ROCm/PyTorch/TensorFlow version differences
13. Suggest which environment to use for different tasks

Generate a detailed comparison report with:
- Side-by-side package version table
- Venn diagram data of package overlap
- Recommendations for consolidation or specialization
- Use case recommendations for each environment
