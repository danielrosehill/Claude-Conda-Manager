# Suggest New Environments

Analyze the user's existing environments and workflow to suggest new baseline or specialized environments that would be beneficial.

Tasks:
1. Analyze existing environments to understand current use cases
2. Identify gaps in the current environment portfolio
3. Consider the user's AMD/ROCm hardware for GPU-accelerated workloads
4. Suggest baseline general-purpose environments with common AI/ML packages
5. Recommend specialized environments for:
   - Deep Learning (PyTorch with ROCm)
   - Computer Vision
   - NLP/LLM fine-tuning
   - Speech-to-Text (Whisper, etc.)
   - Data Science & Analysis
   - Web scraping & automation
   - Video processing
   - Scientific computing
6. Suggest environment consolidation opportunities
7. Recommend package versions compatible with ROCm
8. Provide YAML environment specifications for suggested environments
9. Estimate disk space requirements for new environments

Present suggestions with rationale and implementation details.
