# Cleanup Broken Environments

Identify and safely remove broken, corrupted, or non-functional Conda environments.

Tasks:
1. Scan all conda environments for corruption or errors
2. Attempt to activate each environment to test functionality
3. Check for environments with missing or broken dependencies
4. Identify environments with corrupted metadata
5. Find environments that can't be properly activated
6. Detect environments with unresolvable package conflicts
7. Check for orphaned environment directories
8. Verify environment registry is consistent with actual environments
9. Before removal, create backups of environment configurations
10. Provide options to attempt repair or complete removal
11. Clean up conda cache and temporary files
12. Update conda environment registry after cleanup

For each broken environment found:
- Document what's broken
- Attempt automatic repair if possible
- Backup configuration before removal
- Provide user with removal confirmation option

Generate a cleanup report with all actions taken and disk space recovered.
