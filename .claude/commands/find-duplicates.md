# Find Duplicate Environments

Identify duplicate or very similar Conda environments that could be consolidated to save disk space.

Tasks:
1. List all conda environments with their package inventories
2. Compare environments to find duplicates or near-duplicates
3. Calculate similarity scores between environments
4. Identify environments with largely overlapping package sets
5. Find environments that differ only in minor package versions
6. Detect multiple environments serving the same purpose
7. Calculate disk space that could be saved by consolidation
8. Suggest which environments could be merged or removed
9. Identify the "best" version to keep when duplicates are found
10. Check for environments that haven't been used recently
11. Generate a consolidation plan with recommendations

Provide a detailed report of duplicate environments with specific recommendations for cleanup and consolidation strategies.
