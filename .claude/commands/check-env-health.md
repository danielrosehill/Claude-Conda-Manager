# Check Environment Health

Analyze all Conda environments for health issues, broken dependencies, and optimization opportunities.

Tasks:
1. Check each environment for broken packages or missing dependencies
2. Identify outdated packages with available updates
3. Detect conflicting package versions
4. Check for environments with corrupted metadata
5. Identify packages installed via pip that could cause conflicts
6. Check for unused or redundant packages
7. Verify critical packages (PyTorch, TensorFlow, ROCm) are properly installed
8. Check for security vulnerabilities in installed packages
9. Identify environments that are very large and could be optimized
10. Test if environments can be activated successfully
11. Check for duplicate packages across environments

Provide a health score for each environment and actionable recommendations for improvements.
